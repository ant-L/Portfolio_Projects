# NBA_stats_and_GSW_during_championship_run
In this project I examine NBA statistics and the Golden State Warriors (GSW) during the 2014-15 to 2018-19 NBA seasons.

I aim to explore the NBA statistics and evaluate which stats correlate with wins while also examining how the Warriors have performed in the relevant stats as they've been successful in making it to the playoffs and competing for championships for 5-years running. Utilizing the relevant stats from the analysis, I attempt to build a model that predicts season performance as measured in wins, and the ability to make it into the playoffs.

The project has been broken into separate sections:
* Data resources & information / <a href="https://github.com/ant-L/Portfolio_Projects/blob/master/NBA_stats_and_GSW_during_championship_run/Basketball_Ref_Data_Wrangle.ipynb">data wrangling</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/ant-L/Portfolio_Projects/blob/master/NBA_stats_and_GSW_during_championship_run/Basketball_Ref_EDA.ipynb">Exploratory data analysis</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/ant-L/Portfolio_Projects/blob/master/NBA_stats_and_GSW_during_championship_run/Basketball_Ref_Model_Prediction.ipynb">Model prediction</a>
