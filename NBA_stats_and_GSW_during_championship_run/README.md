# NBA_stats_and_GSW_during_championship_run
This is my first project where I examine NBA statistics and the Golden State Warriors (GSW) during the 2014-15 to 2018-19 NBA seasons.

The project has been broken into separate sections:
* Data resources & information / <a href="https://github.com/ant-L/Portfolio_Projects/blob/master/NBA_stats_and_GSW_during_championship_run/Basketball_Ref_Data_Wrangle.ipynb">data wrangling</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/ant-L/Portfolio_Projects/blob/master/NBA_stats_and_GSW_during_championship_run/Basketball_Ref_EDA.ipynb">Exploratory data analysis</a>
* Model prediction (In progress)

Here's my introductory post for this <a href="https://sempercrescens.blogspot.com/2019/07/nba-statistics-and-golden-state.html"> project</a> on my blog. 

Feel free to comment or send a message if you have any questions or suggestions for this project.
